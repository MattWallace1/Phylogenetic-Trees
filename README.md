# Phylogenetic-Trees
The organisms JSON file contains a dictionary of animals and their amino acid sequences. We compute Needleman-Wunsch scores (similarity scores) between species using a dynamic programming solution. From this, a Phylogenetic Tree is constructed from the bottom-up with single linkage clustering using Kruskal's and union find.
