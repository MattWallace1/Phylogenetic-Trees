# Phylogenetic-Trees
The organisms JSON file contains a dictionary of animals and their amino acid sequences. We can compute Needleman-Wunsch scores (similarity scores) between pairs of animals in order to compare species. From this, a Phylogenetic Tree can be constructed from the bottom-up using Kruskal's algorithm which is implemented using union-find.
